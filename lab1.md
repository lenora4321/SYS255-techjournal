### vSphere
vSphere is the more web-compatible version of VMWare Workstation.  It is used to create virtual machines, run them, take snapshots, and perform other functions useful for technical operations that would be better if performed in a sandbox environment.

To get to virtual machines, go to the VMs and Templates tab at the top left.  There you will find any VMs you have or that have been created for you.  These can be powered on/off, suspended, and configured in any number of network nad hardware settings, making them very useful for networking operations testing and learning.
