# Supplement 5 - WordPress Configuration Resources

## Overview
WordPress is a content management tool that can be installed on a Linux as well as a PC system.  I installed it on web01 for practice.  It required also a LAMP, which basically means Linux (the OS, already had), Apache (web server, already had), MySQL (installed with MariaDB), PHP (already had, but updated to PHP 7.2 for this exercise).  The installation and setup is very similar to the Windows XAMPP work I've done in the past with Laravel for web app creation.

Most of the steps I followed to make a new blog site were found off of the internet.  Below are some of the sites referenced that could be very useful in recreating such a blog site for the future.
