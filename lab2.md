## Technical Terms

### DNS 
The acronym DNS stands for "Domain Name System".  It a network's way of translating between hostnames (like www.google.com) and IP addresses (like 8.8.8.8).  All websites and systems are typically known by their IP addresses in order to navigate between them; however, humans don't tend to be the best at memorizing strings of numbers.  DNS makes it so that humans can type in a hostname and the computer looks up the IP using DNS so that it can find the correct resource and display it back from  behind the scenes, so the user never has to worry about the IP address.
